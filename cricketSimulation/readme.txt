Hello Reader,

This project simulates the CRICKET problem with three cases asked in question PDF which are as follows

1: Toss
2: Last Four Over
3: Tie Breaker

'Main' Class of this project is the entry point of this application.
This class simulates all of the 3 mentioned scenario

while running this application, program argument needs to be provided. e.g. Clear Day
For 2nd Problem : while selecting program argument, provide condition favourable to Lengaburu to bat first,
as the player probabilities are available only for Lengaburu.


Match class is a singleton class
Same match Object is used for simulating all three cases with match object's properties reset after every case.
Custom checked exception is introduced to take care of exception raised in application.


Please let me know if you need more information to run/understand/evaluate this project.
I will be available on call in office hours
